# cpprcon
 A basic RCON library created for use with Minecraft Servers

# Usage
As this is a header only library just include the header file into your project and youre good to go!

You can find a basic example on how to use this library in [example.cpp](./example.cpp)

# DISCLAIMER
As this is my first time getting in touch with networking, i didn`t handle receiving messages as well as i should have had.

The library was only tested with Minecraft servers, it should work with other things using RCON but no guarantee!

Especially distinguishing between two packets with the same id.

If you know how to improve anything please open a [pull request](https://github.com/JustusWalter-Helk/cpprcon/pulls).
